# Overview

Lose yourself in mathematical puzzles and give your mind that ‘me time’ it deserves. This website will help you to find peace in a frantic world, by putting your worries to one side. Your brain will be given a gentle workout, leaving you feeling fresh and at rest. 

To solve a sudoku puzzle, you must use a combination of logic, trial and error and mathematical thinking. The aim of the game is to complete every square, row, and column using only the numbers 1-9, all of which can only appear once.

The site itself is fully responsive and is designed in a simplistic and easy to read manner. Although the website contains ‘form’ elements, due to no back-end functionality the entered fields will not be sent anywhere.
